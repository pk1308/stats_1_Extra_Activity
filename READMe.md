# Statistics 1 Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my Statistics 1 portfolio! This portfolio showcases my engagement in the first extra activity, which consists of three parts aimed at enhancing my understanding of statistical concepts through practical applications.

### Activity 1: Google Site and Statistics 1
In this activity, I've created a Google Site that serves as my student portfolio. Within the site, you'll find a dedicated page for Statistics 1. This page provides a concise yet informative description of the Statistics 1 course, offering visitors a glimpse into its content and significance.

### Activity 2.1: Dataset Selection
For Activity 2.1, I have selected a dataset from a reliable source related to [Your Topic of Interest]. The dataset includes at least 1000 rows and a minimum of 5 columns, comprising both categorical and numerical variables. I've made sure to cite the source link and adhere to ethical data usage practices.

### Activity 2.3: Data Transfer to Google Spreadsheet
To complete Activity 2.3, I've transferred the chosen dataset to a Google Spreadsheet. You can access the spreadsheet directly from my Student Portfolio page or use the provided link.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Task 1: Variable Identification
Within the dedicated Google Spreadsheet, I've performed the following tasks:

1. **Identification of Variables:**
   - Categorical and Numerical Variables
   - Scales of Measurement of the Variables
   - Discrete and Continuous Variables

   For each identification, I've provided a rationale, explaining the reasoning behind the categorization.

### Task 2: Data Visualization
I've created suitable plots to visualize the dataset, carefully choosing each plot type based on its appropriateness. The selected plots aim to highlight key trends within the data. For each visualization, I've included a brief explanation of why I chose that specific plot and an interpretation of the trends observed.

Feel free to explore my Statistics 1 portfolio to delve into the details of these activities and gain insights into my practical application of statistical concepts. I'm excited to share my learning journey with you!
